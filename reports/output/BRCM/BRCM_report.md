# CRITICAL INVESTMENT WARNING

## BRCM (Broadcom Corp.) - DELISTED/ACQUIRED ENTITY

**DO NOT INVEST** - This company no longer exists as a publicly traded entity.

### Key Facts:
- **Status**: Delisted/Acquired in 2015-2016
- **Acquired by**: Avago Technologies (now Broadcom Inc. - AVGO)
- **Last SEC Filing**: October 2015
- **Trading Status**: FALSE (not actively trading)
- **Current Alternative**: AVGO (Broadcom Inc.)

### Critical Findings:
1. BRCM was acquired by Avago Technologies in a ~$37 billion transaction completed in early 2016
2. The company has not filed with the SEC since October 2015
3. Profile data shows "isActivelyTrading: false"
4. Any financial metrics shown are either 9+ years old or synthetic/corrupted
5. Mathematical impossibilities in data (negative Enterprise Value of -$952M)

### Investment Implications:
- **Investment Risk**: 100% loss probability if attempting to trade
- **Action Required**: Do not attempt to purchase BRCM shares
- **Alternative**: For Broadcom exposure, analyze AVGO (Broadcom Inc.)

### Why This Matters:
This case demonstrates the critical importance of verifying company status before conducting any investment analysis. The presence of a ticker symbol does not guarantee the company is actively trading. Always confirm:
- Current trading status
- Recent SEC filings (within 12 months)
- No delisting or acquisition events

### Recommendation:
Investors seeking exposure to Broadcom's semiconductor business should analyze **AVGO (Broadcom Inc.)**, which is the current publicly traded entity resulting from the Avago-Broadcom merger.

**Note**: A full institutional research report cannot be generated for a delisted company. The data anomalies, lack of current filings, and confirmed inactive status make any traditional equity analysis impossible and potentially misleading.
