## Top Signals

### 1. WMT - Walmart Inc.

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $119.70 | **Change:** +4.5% | **Date:** 2026-01-18

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Walmart's stock surged 4.5% on Tuesday, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $119.70 on extremely heavy trading volume that was 5 times the daily average. This rally appears to be driven by the retailer's efforts to attract higher-income shoppers and better compete with e-commerce giant Amazon.

Recent news reports that Walmart is "sprucing up its home goods" by introducing premium products like a $1,699 espresso machine. This strategic move aims to appeal to a more affluent customer base and narrow the gap with Amazon's luxury offerings. The strong technical signals, including the price breakout and volume spike, suggest institutional investors are actively accumulating Walmart shares in anticipation of these initiatives paying off.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching Walmart's upcoming earnings report and any updates on its strategy to challenge Amazon's dominance in the e-commerce space. While the near-term outlook appears positive, the company will need to execute flawlessly to maintain its momentum against the formidable competition.

### 2. MTSI - MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $220.68 | **Change:** +26.2% | **Date:** 2026-01-18

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

MACOM Technology Solutions (MTSI) stock surged 26.2% this week, breaking out to a new all-time high of $220.68 on strong volume. The catalyst behind the stock's rally appears to be growing investor optimism around the company's prospects in the satellite communications market.

Recent news reports have highlighted MACOM's positioning to benefit from the boom in low-Earth-orbit satellite deployments, particularly by SpaceX. The company's semiconductor products are seen as well-suited for the satellite communications industry, which is experiencing rapid growth driven by the proliferation of satellite internet and other space-based technologies. The stock's technical signals, including the breakout to a new 52-week high and above-average trading volume, suggest institutional investors are actively accumulating shares in anticipation of further upside.

Looking ahead, MACOM's ties to the Department of Defense and the broader AI/machine learning industry are also generating investor interest. With the company's recent hiring of industry veteran Bryan Ingram, MACOM may be poised to capitalize on increased government and commercial demand for its specialized semiconductor solutions. However, investors should monitor any potential risks or headwinds that could impact the company's satellite-related business going forward.

### 3. SLB - SLB N.V.

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $45.20 | **Change:** +12.4% | **Date:** 2026-01-11

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + SMA200_CROSSOVER  *(+confluence)*

SLB, the leading oilfield services provider, has seen its stock surge 12.4% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $45.20. This rally appears to be driven by a combination of strong technical signals and positive fundamental developments.

The technical indicators point to significant institutional buying activity. The stock has crossed above its 200-day moving average, a bullish sign, and is displaying strong momentum with heavy trading volume. These technical signals suggest that investors are actively accumulating SLB shares, likely in anticipation of the company's upcoming Q4 earnings report.

Fundamentally, recent news highlights SLB's robust financial position, with double-digit profitability, healthy liquidity, and a sizable cash balance that supports the stability of its dividend. Additionally, geopolitical shifts in Venezuela could potentially expand SLB's addressable market, though some risks remain. Overall, the market seems to be pricing in excessive optimism around SLB's future prospects, as investors position themselves ahead of the company's earnings release and potential further upside.

### 4. AMKR - Amkor Technology, Inc.

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $52.29 | **Change:** +21.8% | **Date:** 2026-01-11

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Amkor Technology, Inc. (AMKR) has seen a significant surge in its stock price, climbing 21.8% this week and breaking out to a new 52-week high of $52.29. This sharp upward movement appears to be driven by a combination of positive news and strong technical signals.

The key catalyst behind AMKR's rally seems to be the company's growing strategic partnerships and positioning in the advanced semiconductor packaging market. Recent reports indicate that Amkor is leveraging the US Chips Act funding to build a $7 billion facility in Arizona, which is set to begin packaging advanced chips for major clients like Nvidia starting in 2027-2028. This long-term growth prospect is further bolstered by surging demand for Nvidia's H200 chips, with a projected 2 million unit order from China in 2026 that could drive significant packaging volumes for Amkor.

The technical signals detected, including the ATH breakout and strong momentum, suggest that institutional investors are actively accumulating AMKR shares in anticipation of these positive developments. With the company's upcoming Investor Day event scheduled for later this month, investors will be closely watching for any additional updates or guidance that could further fuel the stock's rally.

### 5. TTC - The Toro Company

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $89.06 | **Change:** +11.1% | **Date:** 2026-01-11

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + SMA200_CROSSOVER  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative synthesizing the recent news and signals for The Toro Company (TTC):

Shares of The Toro Company surged over 11% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $89.06 and crossing above their 200-day moving average. The catalyst appears to be a strong Q4 earnings report, where the company posted results that beat analyst expectations. The professional segment of Toro's business remained robust, though the residential division saw some margin pressure.

The technical signals support the bullish price action, with the stock displaying strong momentum and institutional accumulation. The high-volume breakout to new highs, along with the 200-day moving average crossover, suggest a potential shift to a new "baby bull market" phase for Toro's stock. Traders have also been actively purchasing put options, potentially hedging against further upside or positioning for a near-term pullback.

Looking ahead, Toro's future outlook remains somewhat murky, as the company navigates uneven business momentum across its segments. Dividend growth has also started to slow, which could be a concern for income-oriented investors. However, with the stock's technical strength and positive earnings surprise, Toro appears to have regained the confidence of the market for now, setting the stage for a potential continuation of the recent rally.

### 6. VICR - Vicor Corporation

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $142.31 | **Change:** +21.8% | **Date:** 2026-01-11

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Vicor Corporation (NASDAQ: VICR) stock surged 21.8% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $142.31. The key catalyst behind this rally appears to be the company's strong positioning in the growing AI and data center power delivery market.

Recent news reports highlight Vicor's unique Gen 5 chipsets and vertical power delivery systems, which are well-suited to address the surging power demands of AI-driven applications. Investors seem to be accumulating shares ahead of the company's potential growth in this high-margin, high-growth segment. The strong momentum and above-average trading volume suggest institutional buyers are actively participating in the rally.

However, the news also indicates some insider selling activity, with a director and the CEO cashing in a portion of their holdings. While this may raise some short-term concerns, Vicor's robust cash flows, debt-free balance sheet, and resilient margins suggest the company remains well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term trends in the data center and AI power delivery market.

### 7. OS - OneStream, Inc. Class A Common Stock

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $23.62 | **Change:** +33.3% | **Date:** 2026-01-11

**Signals:** MOMENTUM + SMA50_CROSSOVER + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative synthesizing the recent news and signals for OneStream (OS):

The 33.3% surge in OneStream's (OS) stock price this week appears to be driven by a combination of strong technical signals and potential corporate activity. The company saw a massive 7.1x spike in trading volume, indicating heavy institutional buying, as the stock broke out above its 50-day moving average. This momentum has pushed OS to all-time highs.

The recent news provides some context for the stock's movement. Reports indicate that a director and the chief accounting officer have made significant insider sales, potentially signaling an upcoming corporate event. Additionally, the law firm Berman Tabacco has announced an investigation into a potential take-private transaction involving private equity firms Hg Capital, General Atlantic, and Tidemark. This acquisition speculation seems to be fueling the stock's sharp rise.

Going forward, investors will be closely watching for any updates on the potential take-private deal. If confirmed, the premium paid by the private equity buyers could drive OS shares even higher. However, the insider selling and investigation also introduce some uncertainty around the company's future. Traders should monitor the stock's ability to hold above the $23 level, which has now become a key support.

### 8. AXSM - Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $178.69 | **Change:** +17.5% | **Date:** 2026-01-04

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM) stock surged 17.5% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $178.69 on strong trading volume. The catalyst behind this rally appears to be the company's positive preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2025.

Axsome reported that its total net product revenue for Q4 2025 reached $196 million, representing 65% year-over-year growth. For the full year 2025, net product revenue hit $638.5 million, up 66% from the prior year. These strong sales figures suggest Axsome's pharmaceutical products are gaining traction in the market, driving the stock's momentum.

The technical signals reinforce the positive fundamental news. The stock's breakout to new highs, accompanied by a spike in trading volume, indicates that institutional investors are actively accumulating shares. This bullish activity could continue if Axsome can sustain its growth trajectory and capitalize on upcoming pipeline developments, such as the ongoing Phase III study for its fibromyalgia treatment AXS-14.

### 9. ASTS - AST SpaceMobile, Inc.

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $115.77 | **Change:** +18.5% | **Date:** 2026-01-18

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative explaining the recent movement in AST SpaceMobile's stock (ASTS):

AST SpaceMobile's stock surged 18.5% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $115.77, as investors reacted positively to the company winning a key contract with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The SHIELD contract will see AST SpaceMobile leverage its low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite network to boost U.S. missile defense and secure communications capabilities. This represents a significant expansion of AST's footprint in the lucrative defense and government services market.

The strong technical signals, including the all-time high breakout and heavy trading volume, suggest institutional investors are actively accumulating shares in anticipation of the growth opportunities presented by the SHIELD contract. AST's satellite technology, which enables direct-to-cell broadband from space, appears to be gaining traction with both commercial and government customers as a differentiated solution in the rapidly evolving space-based communications landscape.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching for further contract wins and partnership announcements that could drive continued momentum in AST SpaceMobile's stock. However, the company still faces execution risks as it scales its novel satellite network, and the competitive dynamics of the space industry remain highly uncertain. Nonetheless, the SHIELD contract represents a significant validation of AST's capabilities and a potential catalyst for the stock in the near-term.

### 10. ADM - Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $65.18 | **Change:** +5.2% | **Date:** 2026-01-18

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + SMA200_CROSSOVER  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative explaining the recent movement in Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) stock:

Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) stock surged 5.2% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $65.18. The rally appears to be driven by increased institutional buying, as evidenced by the stock crossing above its 200-day moving average and seeing 3x the normal trading volume. This suggests large investors are actively accumulating shares ahead of the company's upcoming Q4 2025 earnings report on February 3rd.

The technical signals detected, including the ATH breakout and strong momentum, align with the recent news that several major investment firms have been increasing their positions in ADM. Donoghue Forlines LLC and ASR Vermogensbeheer N.V. both disclosed new or expanded stakes in the agricultural processing company over the past week. This institutional buying activity is likely fueling the stock's push to new highs.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching ADM's Q4 results for any updates on the company's financial performance and outlook. With the stock trading at all-time highs, the market appears to be pricing in strong earnings. However, any surprises or guidance changes could lead to volatility in the share price in the near-term.

ZTO Express, the Chinese logistics and delivery company, has seen its stock surge to new all-time highs this week, rising 2.9% on Tuesday. The key catalyst appears to be growing investor confidence in the company's ability to navigate industry headwinds and continue delivering strong financial results. Recent news reports highlight ZTO as one of the more resilient players in the transportation services sector, with parcel volumes, revenue growth, and improving liquidity fueling optimism about the company's prospects.

The technical signals reinforce this positive sentiment. ZTO's stock has broken out to a new 52-week high, crossing above its 200-day moving average - both strong indications of institutional accumulation and rising momentum. The high-volume breakout, with trading volume 3 times the daily average, suggests large investors are actively buying shares in anticipation of further upside.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching ZTO's upcoming financial results and any updates on the company's strategic initiatives. While the freight industry continues to face macroeconomic headwinds, ZTO appears well-positioned to capitalize on China's growing e-commerce market and maintain its status as a leading logistics provider. As long as the company can sustain its operational and financial momentum, the stock's recent rally may have further room to run.

Advanced Energy Industries' stock surged 15.6% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $253.86. The catalyst behind this strong performance appears to be the company's positive outlook on its data center business and expectations for an upswing in semiconductor equipment demand by 2026.

### 15. UEC - Uranium Energy Corp.

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $17.87 | **Change:** +21.1% | **Date:** 2026-01-18

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM  *(+confluence)*

Uranium Energy Corp. (UEC) has seen a significant surge in its stock price, with the shares climbing over 21% this week and breaking out to a new 52-week high of $17.87. This rally appears to be driven by a combination of positive industry developments and strong investor sentiment.

The recent news highlights several factors contributing to UEC's momentum. First, the company announced the appointment of a high-profile industry veteran, Canon Bryan, to its board of directors. Bryan's experience includes co-founding several successful nuclear energy companies, which likely signals confidence in UEC's growth prospects. Additionally, the news of a partnership between Oklo and Meta Platforms to develop a large-scale nuclear power project suggests growing institutional interest and adoption of advanced nuclear technologies, which could benefit UEC as a leading uranium producer.

Looking ahead, investors will likely be closely watching for any further updates or announcements from UEC that could continue to drive the stock's strong technical performance and momentum. With the company's shares breaking out to new highs and exhibiting strong volume, the market appears to be signaling increased conviction in UEC's ability to capitalize on the ongoing resurgence in nuclear power as a clean energy solution.

### 16. PL - Planet Labs PBC

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $28.78 | **Change:** +26.7% | **Date:** 2026-01-18

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative explaining the recent stock movement for Planet Labs PBC (PL):

Planet Labs PBC's stock surged 26.7% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $28.78 on strong momentum. The catalyst appears to be a series of positive developments highlighted in recent news coverage. Planet Labs reported a sharp growth inflection in its most recent quarter, with revenue up 33% year-over-year and a surging backlog of $734.5 million, up 216%. The company's satellite services model is driving greater capital efficiency, shifting from capital-intensive growth to a more capital-light, recurring revenue model through long-term customer contracts. This has enabled Planet Labs to turn a corner on profitability, with four consecutive quarters of positive adjusted EBITDA and an outlook for positive free cash flow in the coming fiscal year.

The technical signals reinforce the fundamental strength, with the stock breaking out to new highs on volume 3x the daily average. This suggests strong institutional buying interest as investors get more bullish on Planet Labs' long-term growth prospects. Analysts like Dan Ives of Wedbush have turned increasingly positive, noting that the stock has already surged over 500% in the past year but still has further upside potential.

Looking ahead, Planet Labs' focus on AI-powered analytics and its diversified government and commercial customer base position it well to capitalize on the broader growth trends in the space technology industry. However, the company's heavy investments in growth may continue to weigh on near-term profitability, so investors will be closely watching for signs of the profit inflection materializing as planned.

### 17. INTC - Intel Corporation

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $45.55 | **Change:** +15.7% | **Date:** 2026-01-11

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative synthesizing the news and signals for Intel's stock movement:

Intel's stock surged 15.7% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $45.55, as investors anticipate strong Q4 earnings results later this month. The company is benefiting from robust demand for its latest Panther Lake PC processors as well as soaring orders for its server chips driven by the AI boom. Options traders are also betting that Intel's stock could push even higher after the earnings report.

The technical signals support the positive sentiment, with the stock displaying strong momentum and breaking out to new highs on above-average trading volume. This suggests institutional investors are actively accumulating Intel shares ahead of the earnings release and potentially other upcoming catalysts.

Looking ahead, Intel's ability to capitalize on the AI-fueled demand for its server chips will be a key focus. Additionally, the company's progress in the foundry business, where it aims to challenge industry leader TSMC, could emerge as an important long-term driver. However, any signs of execution missteps or competitive pressures in the PC and server CPU markets would be risks to monitor.

### 18. REGN - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $796.55 | **Change:** +2.6% | **Date:** 2026-01-11

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + SMA200_CROSSOVER  *(+confluence)*

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN) stock has been on a strong upward trajectory, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $796.55 and crossing above its 200-day simple moving average. This bullish technical activity suggests institutional investors are actively accumulating shares of the biopharmaceutical company.

The recent news provides some context for this price action. Fiduciary Family Office LLC disclosed a new stake in Regeneron worth approximately $481,000, while another investment firm, Dillon & Associates Inc., reduced its position. This mixed institutional activity indicates there is ongoing interest and demand for Regeneron's stock. Additionally, Regeneron presented at the 44th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, which likely generated positive sentiment among investors.

Looking ahead, Regeneron will be a stock to watch as the company continues to execute on its pipeline and potentially make further advancements in its drug development programs. Investors will want to monitor any updates or catalysts that could drive the stock higher in the coming weeks and months.

### 19. RKT - Rocket Companies, Inc.

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $23.29 | **Change:** +17.2% | **Date:** 2026-01-11

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM  *(+confluence)*

Rocket Companies, Inc. (RKT) stock surged 17.2% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $23.29 on strong momentum. The catalyst behind this rally appears to be positive news around Redfin, the real estate brokerage powered by Rocket's technology.

According to recent reports, Redfin revealed that one of the most popular homes on its platform in 2025 was a remodeled Spanish-style house in Silicon Valley that went under contract for $740,000 over its $4.8 million list price after just one day on the market. This underscores the continued strength in the housing market, which is a key driver for Rocket's mortgage and real estate businesses. The high trading volume and new highs suggest institutional investors are actively accumulating RKT shares in anticipation of further growth.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching Rocket's upcoming earnings report and any updates on its strategic initiatives, including the recently launched Defiance Daily Target 2X Long RKT ETF (RKTL). While the housing market faces some economic headwinds, Rocket's leading position in mortgage origination and its diversification into real estate services appear to be resonating with the market.

### 20. SNDK - Sandisk Corporation

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $377.41 | **Change:** +37.1% | **Date:** 2026-01-11

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative explaining the recent movement in Sandisk's stock price:

Sandisk's stock surged 37.1% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $377.41, as the company continues to benefit from the booming demand for data storage driven by the AI infrastructure buildout. Recent news reports highlight Sandisk's technology leadership and improving profitability, which contrast with the more capital-intensive model of competitor Applied Digital. Analysts are particularly bullish on Sandisk's positioning, with one noting that the "NAND trade is getting crowded" and predicting that a pricing upcycle should flow straight into Sandisk's average selling prices and gross margins.

The strong technical signals, including the breakout to new highs on heavy trading volume, suggest institutional investors are actively accumulating Sandisk shares ahead of the company's upcoming Q2 earnings report. Analysts will be closely watching Sandisk's guidance, with a revenue and EPS outlook above current Street estimates potentially signaling an even faster ramp-up in demand from hyperscale cloud providers.

Looking ahead, Sandisk appears well-positioned to continue benefiting from the AI infrastructure boom, given its technology leadership and improving profitability. However, the stock's rapid ascent has also led to concerns that the "NAND trade" may be getting overcrowded, so investors will need to monitor the sustainability of Sandisk's momentum, especially in the face of potential macroeconomic headwinds.
