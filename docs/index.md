## Top Signals

### 1. IBRX - ImmunityBio, Inc.

**Score:** 12 | **Price:** $5.52 | **Change:** +136.9% | **Date:** 2026-01-16

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + SMA200_CROSSOVER + SMA50_CROSSOVER + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

ImmunityBio, Inc. (IBRX) has seen a remarkable surge in its stock price, with shares soaring over 136% in the past week. This sharp rally appears to be driven by a combination of positive clinical data and strong commercial performance for the company's lead cancer immunotherapy, Anktiva.

The key catalyst behind IBRX's price movement is the updated data from the company's study of its CD19 t-haNK therapy in Waldenstrom lymphoma. The results showed durable complete responses in patients without the need for chemotherapy or lymphodepletion, a significant development that has generated significant investor enthusiasm. Additionally, ImmunityBio reported a 700% year-over-year jump in Anktiva revenue, further bolstering confidence in the commercial potential of the company's pipeline.

The technical signals detected, including an all-time high breakout, a major volume spike, and strong momentum across the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, suggest that institutional investors are actively accumulating IBRX shares. With the company's upcoming presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference and potential for additional regulatory approvals, investors will be closely watching ImmunityBio's progress in the coming months as it continues to advance its innovative cancer immunotherapy platform.

### 2. HAL - Halliburton Company

**Score:** 8 | **Price:** $32.63 | **Change:** +10.2% | **Date:** 2026-01-09

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + SMA200_CROSSOVER + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Halliburton Company's stock surged 10.2% on Tuesday, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $32.63. This strong price action was accompanied by above-average trading volume, suggesting institutional investors are actively accumulating shares.

The key catalyst behind Halliburton's rally appears to be anticipation around the company's upcoming Q4 earnings report. Recent news articles highlight that analysts are expecting Halliburton to post a solid quarter, driven by cost-cutting measures and margin improvements, even as overall revenues face year-over-year pressure. The stock's move above the 200-day simple moving average further indicates growing bullish momentum.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching Halliburton's earnings call for updates on the company's outlook, particularly in light of the ongoing geopolitical tensions in Venezuela. Any clarity on the potential for regulatory reforms that could give international oil companies more control over exports would likely be a key focus area and could further fuel the stock's rally.

### 3. RVMD - Revolution Medicines, Inc.

**Score:** 8 | **Price:** $118.64 | **Change:** +50.1% | **Date:** 2026-01-09

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative explaining the recent movement in Revolution Medicines (RVMD) stock:

Shares of Revolution Medicines surged over 50% this week, breaking out to a new all-time high of $118.64. The catalyst appears to be the company's strong performance at the recent J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, where it presented updates on its oncology pipeline. Investors were particularly excited about the company's lead drug candidates targeting difficult-to-treat cancers, which have shown promising results in early clinical trials.

The technical signals support the bullish sentiment around Revolution Medicines. The stock's breakout to a new 52-week high was accompanied by a spike in trading volume to 4 times the daily average, indicating high-intent buying activity. This momentum has pushed the stock up over 50% just this week, reflecting the market's enthusiasm for the company's progress.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching for any further updates on Revolution Medicines' clinical programs, especially as the company prepares for key data readouts in the coming months. While the stock's rapid ascent carries some risk of a pullback, the positive news flow and strong technical signals suggest that the market believes Revolution Medicines is well-positioned to continue its momentum in the near term.

### 4. COMP - Compass, Inc.

**Score:** 8 | **Price:** $12.84 | **Change:** +22.3% | **Date:** 2026-01-09

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Compass, Inc. (COMP) stock surged 22.3% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $12.84 on strong trading volume. The catalyst behind this rally appears to be a combination of positive news and growing investor optimism.

The key driver was an upgrade of COMP to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, which suggests improving earnings prospects for the company. Additionally, the company's relocation services subsidiary, Cartus, announced that it has become the first major global talent mobility firm to have its near-term and net-zero greenhouse gas reduction targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. This sustainability milestone likely appealed to environmentally-conscious investors.

The technical signals reinforce the bullish sentiment, with the stock breaking out to new highs on volume 3.8x the daily average. This suggests strong institutional buying pressure as investors position themselves ahead of Compass' upcoming merger completion and focus on execution. Going forward, the market will be closely watching the company's ability to capitalize on this momentum and deliver on its strategic initiatives.

### 5. WMT - Walmart Inc.

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $119.70 | **Change:** +4.5% | **Date:** 2026-01-16

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Walmart's stock surged 4.5% on Tuesday, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $119.70 on extremely heavy trading volume that was 5 times the daily average. This rally appears to be driven by the retailer's efforts to attract higher-income shoppers and better compete with e-commerce giant Amazon.

Recent news reports that Walmart is "sprucing up its home goods" by introducing premium products like a $1,699 espresso machine. This suggests the company is trying to appeal to a more affluent customer base and differentiate itself from Amazon's core value-focused offerings. The strong technical signals, including the price breakout and volume spike, indicate institutional investors are actively accumulating Walmart shares in anticipation of these strategic initiatives paying off.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching Walmart's upcoming earnings report and any updates on its efforts to attract higher-income consumers. While the stock's recent momentum is encouraging, the company still faces the challenge of fending off Amazon's relentless expansion into new retail categories. Maintaining this share price momentum will depend on Walmart's ability to execute on its plan to reposition the brand and win over a new demographic of shoppers.

### 6. MTSI - MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $220.68 | **Change:** +26.2% | **Date:** 2026-01-16

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

MACOM Technology Solutions (MTSI) stock surged 26.2% this week, breaking out to a new all-time high of $220.68 on strong volume. The catalyst appears to be growing investor optimism around the company's prospects in the satellite communications market.

Recent news reports highlight MACOM's semiconductor products that are well-positioned to benefit from the boom in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite deployments, particularly by companies like SpaceX. Analysts have noted MACOM's thematic ties to the broader AI and defense technology trends, which are driving increased demand for its radio frequency (RF) and photonic integrated circuit solutions. The stock's strong momentum and high-volume breakout to new highs suggest institutional investors are actively accumulating shares based on these favorable industry dynamics.

Looking ahead, MACOM's upcoming earnings report and any further updates on its satellite-related business opportunities will be key factors to watch. While the stock's valuation has become stretched, the company's positioning in fast-growing end markets like space-based communications could continue to support the share price in the near term.

### 7. SLB - SLB N.V.

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $45.20 | **Change:** +12.4% | **Date:** 2026-01-09

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + SMA200_CROSSOVER  *(+confluence)*

Paragraph 1:
SLB N.V. (SLB) stock surged 12.4% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $45.20 as the company's positive momentum continues.

Paragraph 2:
The technical signals detected, including the stock crossing above its 200-day moving average and displaying strong momentum, suggest institutional investors are actively accumulating shares.

Paragraph 3:
While the current optimism around SLB appears to be already priced in, investors will be closely watching the company's upcoming Q4 earnings report for any further updates on its operational and financial performance. Additionally, developments in Venezuela and their impact on SLB's addressable market will be a key factor to monitor going forward.

### 8. AMKR - Amkor Technology, Inc.

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $52.29 | **Change:** +21.8% | **Date:** 2026-01-09

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative synthesizing the news and signals for Amkor Technology (AMKR):

Amkor Technology's stock surged 21.8% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $52.29 on strong trading volume. The catalyst appears to be growing investor optimism around Amkor's strategic positioning in advanced semiconductor packaging, particularly its partnership with Nvidia. 

Recent news highlights Amkor's $7 billion facility in Arizona, which is set to begin packaging Nvidia's H200 chips starting in 2027-2028. This facility is supported by funding from the US Chips Act, bolstering Amkor's long-term growth prospects as demand for advanced packaging services continues to rise. The strong momentum and high-volume breakout to new highs suggest institutional investors are actively accumulating shares in anticipation of Amkor's growing role in Nvidia's supply chain.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching Amkor's upcoming Investor Day on January 15th, where the company may provide further details on its strategic partnerships and capacity expansion plans. While the stock's rapid ascent this week carries some risk of a near-term pullback, Amkor's positioning in the booming advanced packaging market appears to be a key driver of its recent surge.

### 9. TTC - The Toro Company

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $89.06 | **Change:** +11.1% | **Date:** 2026-01-09

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + SMA200_CROSSOVER  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative synthesizing the news and signals for The Toro Company (TTC):

Shares of The Toro Company surged over 11% this week, breaking out to new 52-week highs above $89 per share. The rally was driven by the company's strong Q4 earnings report, which saw revenue and profits beat analyst expectations. Toro's professional segment remained robust, though the residential business saw some margin pressure. Despite the positive earnings, the company's future outlook was described as "still murky" by analysts.

The technical signals support the bullish price action. Toro's stock crossed above its 200-day moving average, indicating a shift in the longer-term trend. Additionally, the high-volume breakout to new highs suggests institutional investors are actively accumulating shares. This momentum is further bolstered by the stock's strong performance over the past week, gaining over 11%.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching Toro's upcoming developer conference, which could provide more clarity on the company's strategic direction and growth prospects. However, the mixed signals in the earnings report highlight the uneven nature of Toro's business, which could pose risks if the economic environment deteriorates further. Overall, the combination of positive earnings, technical breakouts, and institutional buying activity point to a baby bull market emerging for Toro's stock.

### 10. VICR - Vicor Corporation

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $142.31 | **Change:** +21.8% | **Date:** 2026-01-09

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Vicor Corporation (NASDAQ: VICR) has seen a significant surge in its stock price, with shares jumping 21.8% this week and breaking out to a new 52-week high of $142.31. This sharp rise appears to be driven by a combination of positive news and strong technical signals.

The key catalyst behind Vicor's stock movement seems to be the company's positioning in the growing market for next-generation data center power delivery. Recent news reports highlight Vicor's unique Gen 5 chipsets and vertical power delivery systems, which are well-suited to address the surging power demands of AI-driven applications. This technological edge has positioned Vicor as a compelling growth opportunity for investors, as evidenced by the strong momentum and above-average trading volume observed this week.

Furthermore, Vicor's financial fundamentals also appear to be robust, with the company demonstrating resilient cash flows and a debt-free balance sheet. While there has been some insider selling activity, likely representing normal portfolio rebalancing, the overall tone around Vicor remains positive. Investors will likely be closely watching the company's upcoming events and developments, as Vicor continues to capitalize on the growing demand for its innovative power delivery solutions.

### 11. OS - OneStream, Inc. Class A Common Stock

**Score:** 7 | **Price:** $23.62 | **Change:** +33.3% | **Date:** 2026-01-09

**Signals:** MOMENTUM + SMA50_CROSSOVER + VOLUME_SPIKE  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative explaining the recent movement in OneStream (OS) stock:

The 33.3% surge in OneStream's (OS) stock price this week appears to be driven by a combination of strong technical signals and potential corporate activity. The company saw a significant volume spike, with trading volume reaching 7.1x the daily average, indicating strong institutional interest and accumulation of shares. Additionally, the stock crossed above its 50-day simple moving average, a bullish technical signal.

The news coverage provides some context for this price action. Reports indicate that a director at OneStream recently sold a sizable portion of their shares, potentially signaling an upcoming corporate event. Furthermore, the law firm Berman Tabacco announced an investigation into a potential take-private transaction involving private equity firms Hg Capital, General Atlantic, and Tidemark. This suggests the possibility of a going-private deal or other significant corporate development that is attracting investor attention and driving the stock's sharp rise.

Looking ahead, investors will likely be closely watching for any updates or confirmations regarding a potential take-private transaction or other strategic moves by OneStream's management and major shareholders. The high trading volume and momentum signals indicate the stock could continue to see elevated volatility in the near term as the market digests the latest developments.

Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM) stock surged 17.5% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $178.69 on above-average trading volume. This strong momentum appears to be driven by the company's positive business updates and progress in its clinical pipeline.

### 13. ASTS - AST SpaceMobile, Inc.

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $115.77 | **Change:** +18.5% | **Date:** 2026-01-16

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative explaining the recent movement in AST SpaceMobile's (ASTS) stock:

AST SpaceMobile's stock surged 18.5% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $115.77, as investors reacted positively to the company winning a key contract with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The SHIELD contract will leverage AST's low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology to boost U.S. missile defense and secure communications capabilities. This represents a significant expansion of the company's defense footprint, which could lead to additional government and military contracts going forward.

The strong momentum and high-volume trading suggest institutional investors are actively accumulating shares of AST SpaceMobile. The stock's breakout to new highs on heavy volume indicates a shift in sentiment, with the market now viewing the company's satellite technology as increasingly valuable for critical national security applications. With the stock's recent gains, AST is now trading well above its previous 52-week high of $102.79, reflecting growing investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing demand for advanced satellite communications.

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching for any updates on the progress of AST's SHIELD contract, as well as the potential for additional defense and government deals that could further drive the stock's momentum. However, the company will also need to manage execution risks and maintain its technological edge to justify its current valuation and continue delivering shareholder value.

### 14. ADM - Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $65.18 | **Change:** +5.2% | **Date:** 2026-01-16

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + SMA200_CROSSOVER  *(+confluence)*

Here is a 3-paragraph narrative explaining the recent movement in Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) stock:

Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) stock surged 5.2% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $65.18. The rally was driven by strong institutional buying activity, as evidenced by the stock crossing above its 200-day moving average with heavy trading volume. This technical breakout suggests that large investors are accumulating shares of the agricultural processing company.

The positive momentum in ADM's stock price appears to be tied to the company's upcoming Q4 2025 earnings report, scheduled for February 3rd. Investors are likely positioning themselves ahead of the results, anticipating that ADM will deliver another quarter of solid financial performance. The company's diverse agricultural commodity business has benefited from favorable market conditions and strong global demand.

Looking ahead, ADM investors will be focused on the company's guidance and commentary around key industry trends, such as crop production, supply chain dynamics, and global trade. While the stock is trading at new highs, continued execution and positive outlooks from management could drive the shares even higher in the near-term. However, any unexpected headwinds or weaker-than-expected results pose a risk to the recent rally.

ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc. shares have surged 2.9% today, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $22.32.

### 19. UEC - Uranium Energy Corp.

**Score:** 6 | **Price:** $17.87 | **Change:** +21.1% | **Date:** 2026-01-16

**Signals:** ATH_BREAKOUT + MOMENTUM  *(+confluence)*

Uranium Energy Corp. (UEC) has seen a significant surge in its stock price, climbing over 21% this week and breaking out to a new 52-week high of $17.87. This sharp rise appears to be driven by a combination of positive industry news and strong technical momentum.

The key catalyst behind UEC's recent gains seems to be the announcement of a groundbreaking partnership between Oklo and Meta Platforms to develop a large-scale 1.2 GW nuclear power campus. This news has likely fueled investor optimism around the broader nuclear energy sector, of which UEC is a major player. The stock's technical signals, including the ATH breakout and strong momentum, suggest that institutional investors are actively accumulating shares, potentially in anticipation of further positive developments in the nuclear space.

Looking ahead, investors will likely be closely watching for any additional news or announcements that could further propel UEC's share price. The company's involvement in various nuclear energy projects, as evidenced by the appointment of a director with experience in the industry, may also be a factor driving interest in the stock. However, as with any investment, caution is warranted, and investors should carefully monitor the evolving market conditions and potential risks associated with the nuclear energy sector.

Planet Labs' stock surged 26.7% this week, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $28.78 on strong momentum. The catalyst appears to be the company's impressive Q3 2026 earnings report, which showed a 33% year-over-year jump in revenue and a 216% surge in backlog to $734.5 million. Investors are excited about Planet Labs' shift to a more capital-efficient, recurring revenue model for its satellite imagery and analytics services.

Looking ahead, investors will be watching for updates on Planet Labs' long-term government and enterprise contracts, as well as the company's progress in transitioning to a more capital-light business model. While heavy investments have weighed on near-term profitability, the market appears confident that Planet Labs' focus on AI-driven analytics will pay off with sustainable, high-margin growth in the years to come.
